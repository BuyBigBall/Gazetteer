## Description: 
> This application is envisaged as a ‚Äúmobile first‚Äú website that will operate equally well on desktop computers. 
> It will provide profiling for all countries through the presentation of demographic, climatic, geographical and other data. 
> This application will make extensive use of third party API's. 

## Workflow:  
> I Used PHP enabled Web server, called XAMPP to develop the application on my Local machine, Macbook.  
> I then deployed the application Live publicly on IONOS Web Hosting Service.

## How I solved one of many errors I encountered during application development 
On Local machine, On loading, the application displayed the position of the user device on the map but once I deployed live on the domain, I encountered the following problems. I almost spent a week on this particular issue but managed to find a solution at the end. 
 ### Issue Log: 
<p> A popup window with an error message saying: Could not get your position on http://thegazetteer.co.uk/ </p>
<p> Found a similar issue on Stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37192827/getcurrentposition-doesnt-work-once-deployed </p>
<p> Found out Google Chrome is no longer supports geolocation on insecure origins. </p>
<p> So, I did further research and found this https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security/deprecating-powerful-features-on-insecure-origins and came to know that I must use HTTPS:// if I want to use geolocation. </p>
<p> Console Warning: [Deprecation] getCurrentPosition() and watchPosition() no longer work on insecure origins. To use this feature, you should consider switching your application to a secure origin, such as HTTPS. See https://goo.gl/rStTGz for more details. </p>
<p> So, I secured the website with SSL certificate:  https://thegazetteer.co.uk/,   </p>
<p> But it threw another error on the console - "Mixed Content" warnings occur when an HTTPS page is asked to load a resource over HTTP </p>
<p> That‚Äôs because I used http://maps.stamen.com/js/tile.stamen.js?v1.3.0 to load map which Is unsecured and I can‚Äôt use it on https connection. </p>
<p> So, I refer http://maps.stamen.com/#terrain/12/37.7706/-122.3782 documentation and I found the following information at the bottom of the site, </p>
<p> SSL </p>
<p> If you'd like to display these map tiles on a website that requires HTTPS, use our tile SSL endpoint by replacing¬†
http://tile.stamen.com¬† with¬†https://stamen-tiles.a.ssl.fastly.net  => Doesn't work </p>
<p> Multiple subdomains can be also be used:¬†https://stamen-tiles-{S}.a.ssl.fastly.net => Doesn't work </p>
<p> JavaScript can be loaded from https://stamen-maps.a.ssl.fastly.net/js/tile.stamen.js  => Worked but doesn't render the names of the geographical areas on the map. </p>
<p> If you need protocol-agnostic URLs, use   //stamen-tiles-{s}.a.ssl.fastly.net/  as that endpoint will work for both SSL and non-SSL connections. => Don‚Äôt know how to use this </p>
<p> I carried on looking for solution and finally found this https://github.com/stamen/maps.stamen.com/issues/120 </p>
<p> One developer suggested to download the actual file from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stamen/maps.stamen.com/master/js/tile.stamen.js and put it in the project folder. 
<p> BOOM!!! Success.......Finally. </p>
